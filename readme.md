# Real-Time Location Tracking with Socket.IO and Leaflet

This project demonstrates a real-time location tracking application using Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, and Leaflet.js. It allows multiple users to share their geographical locations in real-time, visualizing them on an interactive map. The application uses Socket.IO for real-time communication and Leaflet.js for map rendering.

## Features

- **Real-Time Location Sharing**: Users can share their current location with others in real-time.
- **Interactive Map**: The map is rendered using Leaflet.js, displaying user locations as markers.
- **Dynamic Marker Updates**: When a user changes their location, the corresponding marker on the map is updated in real-time.
- **User Disconnection Handling**: When a user disconnects, their marker is removed from the map in real-time.
- **Simulated Multiple Users**: The application can simulate multiple users by opening multiple tabs, each representing a different user with unique coordinates.
